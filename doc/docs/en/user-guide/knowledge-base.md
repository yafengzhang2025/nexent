# Knowledge Base

Create and manage knowledge bases, upload documents, and generate summaries. Knowledge bases are critical information sources that let agents securely use your private data.

## 🔧 Create a Knowledge Base

1. Click **Create Knowledge Base**
2. Enter a descriptive, unique name
   > **Note:** Knowledge base names must be unique and can only contain Chinese characters or lowercase letters. Spaces, slashes, and other special characters are not allowed.

## 📁 Upload Files

### Upload Files

1. Select a knowledge base from the list
2. Click the upload area to pick files (multi-select supported) or drag them in directly
3. Nexent automatically parses files, extracts text, and vectorizes the content
4. Track the processing status in the list (Parsing/Ingesting/Ready)
