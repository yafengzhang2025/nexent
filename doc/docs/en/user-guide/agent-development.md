# Agent Development

In the Agent Development page, you can create, configure, and manage agents. Agents are the core feature of Nexent—they can understand your needs and perform corresponding tasks.

## 🔧 Create an Agent

On the Agent Management tab, click "Create Agent" to create a new blank agent. Click "Exit Create" to leave creation mode.
If you have an existing agent configuration, you can also import it:

1. Click "Import Agent"
2. In the file selection dialog, select the agent configuration file (JSON format)
3. Click "Open"; the system will validate the file format and content, and display the imported agent information

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left;">
  <img src="./assets/agent-development/import.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;" />
</div>

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you import an agent with a duplicate name, a prompt dialog will appear. You can choose:
> - **Import anyway**: Keep the duplicate name; the imported agent will be in an unavailable state and requires manual modification of the Agent name and variable name before it can be used
> - **Regenerate and import**: The system will call the LLM to rename the Agent, which will consume a certain amount of model tokens and may take longer

> 📌 **Important:** For agents created via import, if their tools include `knowledge_base_search` or other knowledge base search tools, these tools will only search **knowledge bases that the currently logged-in user is allowed to access in this environment**. The original knowledge base configuration in the exported agent will *not* be automatically inherited, so actual search results and answer quality may differ from what the original author observed.

</div>

### 🛠️ Select Agent Tools

Agents can use various tools to complete tasks, such as knowledge base search, file parsing, image parsing, email sending/receiving, file management, and other local tools. They can also integrate third-party MCP tools or custom tools.

1. On the "Select Tools" tab, click "Refresh Tools" to update the available tool list
2. Select the group containing the tool you want to add
3. View all available tools under the group; click ⚙️ to view tool details and configure parameters
4. Click the tool name to select/deselect it
   - If the tool has required parameters that are not configured, a popup will appear to guide you through parameter configuration
   - If all required parameters are already configured, the tool will be selected directly

### 🔌 Add MCP Tools

On the "Select Agent Tools" tab, click "MCP Config" to configure MCP servers in the popup and view configured servers.

You can add MCP services to Nexent in the following two ways:

**1️⃣ Add MCP Service via URL**

🔔 This method is suitable for independently deployed MCP services (supports SSE and Streamable HTTP protocols):

>1. In the **Add MCP Server** section at the top of the interface, fill in **Server name** and **Server URL**
>
>⚠️ **Note:** The server name must contain only English letters or digits; spaces, underscores, and other characters are not allowed.
>
>2. Click the **+ Add** button on the right to complete adding a single service

**2️⃣ Add Containerized MCP Service via JSON Configuration**

🔔 This method is suitable for containerized MCP services deployed via npx:

>1. In the **Add Containerized MCP Service** input box, fill in a JSON configuration that matches the example format:
>
>```json
>{
> "mcpServers": {
>   "service-name": {
>     "args": [
>       "mcp-package-name@version",
>       "additional-parameters"
>     ],
>     "command": "npx"
>   }
> }
>}
>```
>
>2. In the **Port** input box below, enter the port number corresponding to the containerized service
>3. Click the **+ Add** button on the right to complete adding the containerized service

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left;">
  <img src="./assets/agent-development/mcp.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;" />
</div>

Many third-party services such as [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/mcp) provide MCP services, which you can quickly integrate and use.
You can also develop your own MCP services and connect them to Nexent; see [MCP Tool Development](../backend/tools/mcp).

### ⚙️ Custom Tools

You can refer to the following guides to develop your own tools and integrate them into Nexent to enrich agent capabilities:

- [LangChain Tools Guide](../backend/tools/langchain)
- [MCP Tool Development](../backend/tools/mcp)
- [SDK Tool Documentation](../sdk/core/tools)

### 🧪 Tool Testing

Nexent provides a "Tool Testing" capability for all types of tools—whether they are built-in tools, externally integrated MCP tools, or custom-developed tools. If you are unsure about a tool's effectiveness when creating an agent, you can use the testing feature to verify that the tool works as expected.

1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to the tool to open the tool's detailed configuration popup
2. First, ensure that all required parameters (marked with red asterisks) are configured
3. Click the "Test Tool" button in the lower left corner of the popup
4. A new test panel will appear on the right side
5. Enter the tool's input parameters in the test panel. For example:
   - When testing the local knowledge base search tool `knowledge_base_search`, you need to enter:
     - The test `query`, such as "benefits of vitamin C"
     - The search `search_mode` (default is `hybrid`)
     - The target index list `index_names`, such as `["Medical", "Vitamin Encyclopedia"]`
     - If `index_names` is not entered, it will default to searching all knowledge bases selected on the knowledge base page
6. After entering the parameters, click "Execute Test" to start the test and view the test results below

</div>

## 📝 Describe Business Logic

### ✍️ Describe How the Agent Should Work

Based on the selected collaborative agents and tools, you can now describe in simple language how you expect this agent to work. Nexent will automatically generate the agent name, description, and prompts based on your configuration and description.

1. In the editor under "Describe how should this agent work", enter a brief description, such as "You are a professional knowledge Q&A assistant with local knowledge search and online search capabilities, synthesizing information to answer user questions"
2. Select a model (choose a smarter model when generating prompts to optimize response logic), click the "Generate Agent" button, and Nexent will generate detailed agent content for you, including basic information and prompts (role, usage requirements, examples)
3. You can edit and fine-tune the auto-generated content (including agent information and prompts) in the Agent Detail Content below

#### 📋 Agent Basic Information Configuration

In the basic information section, if you are not satisfied of the auto-generated content, you can configure the following fields by your own:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Agent Name** | The display name shown in the interface and recognized by users. |
| **Agent Variable Name** | The internal identifier for the agent, used to reference it in code. Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and must start with a letter or underscore. |
| **Author** | The creator of the agent. Defaults to the current logged-in user's email. |
| **User Group** | The user group the agent belongs to, used for permission management and organization. If empty, the agent has no assigned user group. |
| **Group Permission** | Controls how users in the same group can access this agent:<br>- **Editable**: Group members can view and edit the agent<br>- **Read-only**: Group members can only view, not edit<br>- **Private**: Only the creator and administrators can access |
| **Model** | The LLM used by the agent for reasoning and generating responses. |
| **Max Steps of Agent Run** | The maximum number of think-act cycles the agent can execute in a single conversation. More steps allow the agent to handle more complex tasks, but also consume more resources. |
| **Provide Run Summary** | Controls whether the agent provides run details to the main agent when used as a sub-agent:<br>- **Enabled (default)**: When used as a sub-agent, provides a detailed run summary to the main agent<br>- **Disabled**: When used as a sub-agent, only returns the final result without detailed run information |
| **Description** | A description of the agent's functionality, explaining its purpose and capabilities. |

> 💡 **Usage Suggestions**:
> - Use meaningful English names for the agent variable name, such as `code_assistant`, `data_analyst`, etc.
> - Set the max steps based on task complexity: 3-5 steps for simple Q&A, 10-20 steps for complex reasoning tasks
> - Keep "Provide Run Summary" enabled if the sub-agent's run process is valuable for the main agent's decision-making. Disable it if you only need the final result to reduce context consumption.

### 🐛 Debug and Save

After completing the initial agent configuration, you can debug the agent and fine-tune the prompts based on the debugging results to continuously improve agent performance.

1. Click the "Debug" button in the lower right corner of the page to open the agent debug page
2. Test conversations with the agent and observe its responses and behavior
3. Review conversation performance and error messages, and optimize the agent prompts based on the test results

After successful debugging, click the "Save" button in the lower right corner, and the agent will be saved and appear in the agent list.

## 📋 Manage Agents

In the agent list on the left, you can perform the following operations on existing agents:

### 🔗 View Call Relationships

View the collaborative agents/tools used by the agent, displayed in a tree diagram to clearly see the agent call relationships.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left;">
  <img src="./assets/agent-development/agent-relationship.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;" />
</div>

### 📤 Export

Export successfully debugged agents as JSON configuration files. You can use this JSON file to create a copy by importing it when creating an agent.

### 📋 Copy

Copy an agent to facilitate experimentation, multi-version debugging, and parallel development.

### 🗑️ Delete

Delete an agent (this cannot be undone, please proceed with caution).

## 🚀 Next Steps
