# User Management

This page provides a detailed explanation of the Nexent platform's user role system, data visibility scope, operation permissions for various resources, and practical examples of permission configuration.

⚠️ **Important Note**: When deploying v1.8.0 or later for the first time, please pay special attention to the `suadmin` super administrator account information output in the Docker logs. This account has the highest system privileges, and the password is only displayed upon first generation. It cannot be viewed again later, so please be sure to save it securely.

## I. Role System

Nexent adopts a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, dividing user scope through the concepts of tenants and user groups:

### 1.1 What is a Tenant?

- A **Tenant** is the top-level resource isolation unit in the Nexent platform, which can be understood as an independent workspace or organizational unit

- Data between different tenants is completely isolated and invisible to each other. Each tenant can independently create agents, knowledge bases, models, MCPs, etc.

- Only the Super Administrator can manage permissions across tenants and invite tenant administrators

### 1.2 What is a User Group?

- A **User Group** is a collection of users within a tenant. User management and permission control can be achieved through user group division
- A user can belong to multiple user groups
- The visibility of resources such as knowledge bases and agents within a tenant is controlled through user groups

### 1.3 User Roles

Includes the following four core roles:

| Role | Responsibility Description | Applicable Scenarios | Role Notes |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| **Super Administrator** | Can create **different tenants** and manage all tenant resources | Platform operation and maintenance personnel | There is only one Super Administrator in the Nexent system. Account credentials are generated during local deployment. Please keep them safe as they cannot be retrieved after logs are cleared |
| **Administrator** | Responsible for **intra-tenant** resource management and permission allocation | Department managers, tenant leaders | A tenant can have multiple administrators, who can only be invited by the Super Administrator |
| **Developer** | Can create and edit agents, knowledge bases, and other resources, but has no management permissions | Developers, product managers | A tenant can have multiple developers who can belong to multiple user groups within the tenant, invited by administrators and the Super Administrator |
| **Regular User** | Can only use platform features without creation and editing permissions | Employees, business personnel | A tenant can have multiple regular users who can belong to multiple user groups within the tenant, invited by administrators and the Super Administrator |

#### 1.3.1 Super Administrator

The Super Administrator is responsible for the overall operation and maintenance of the platform. They can create tenants and participate in user permission management within each tenant, but cannot use agents.

- ✅ Can manage personnel and permissions for all tenants
- ✅ Can view platform-wide monitoring and operation data
- ❌ Cannot directly view specific business data (such as agent conversation content, knowledge base documents, etc.)
- ❌ Cannot create and use agents, knowledge bases, etc.

#### 1.3.2 Administrator

The Administrator is the highest permission role within a tenant, responsible for resource management and user management within the tenant, with full platform functionality.

- ✅ Can manage all users and user groups within the tenant
- ✅ Can view and edit all agents, knowledge bases, and MCPs within the tenant
- ❌ Cannot access data from other tenants

#### 1.3.3 Developer

The Developer is a technical role within a tenant, responsible for creating and optimizing technical resources such as agents and knowledge bases.

- ✅ Can create agents and knowledge bases and set permissions
- ⚠️ For resources created by others, authorization is required to edit
- ❌ Cannot manage users and user groups within the tenant

#### 1.3.4 Regular User

Regular Users only have permission to use agents for conversations.

- ✅ Can use authorized agents for conversations
- ✅ Can view their own usage records and personal information
- ❌ Cannot create or edit agents, knowledge bases

## III. Resource Permission Comparison

The following tables show the operation permissions of four roles for various types of resources. Among them:

- **Super Administrator**: Can manage resources for all tenants (cross-tenant)
- **Administrator/Developer/Regular User**: Can only operate resources within their own tenant

### 3.1 User and User Group Permissions

## V. Invitation Code Mechanism

Nexent platform uses an invitation code mechanism to control new user registration, ensuring platform security and controllability.

### 5.1 Generating Invitation Codes

- Super Administrators can go to "Tenant Resources" → "Select Tenant" → "Invitation Code"
- Administrators can go directly through "Tenant Resources" → "Invitation Code"
- Click "Create Invitation Code"
- Configure parameters: invitation type (Administrator, Developer, User), invitation code, number of uses, user groups to join, expiration time
- Copy the invitation code and distribute it to relevant personnel

## VI. Practical Examples

This section uses **XX City People's Hospital - Orthopedics Department** as an example to demonstrate how to build a single-department medical intelligent assistant system on the Nexent platform, as well as the workflow of each role in the system.

### 6.1 Overall Architecture Design

#### 6.1.1 Architecture Level Correspondence

In the scenario of XX City People's Hospital, the correspondence between Nexent platform levels and hospital entities is as follows:

| Level | Corresponding Entity | Description |
| ----- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| **Super Administrator** | Hospital Information Center/System Administrator | Manages multiple departments (multiple tenants) of the entire hospital |
| **Single Tenant** | Single Department | Such as: Orthopedics, Cardiology, Surgery |
| **User Groups within Tenant** | Professional groups within the department | Such as: Orthopedics Physician Group, Nursing Group, Rehabilitation Group |
| **Members within User Groups** | Specific medical staff/patients | Such as: Chief Physician of Orthopedics, Charge Nurse, Inpatient |

#### 6.1.2 Definition and Responsibilities of Each Role

| Role | Corresponding Personnel in Orthopedics Tenant | Core Responsibilities | Data Visibility Scope |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Super Administrator** | Hospital Information Center Administrator | Manages multiple tenants of hospital departments (Orthopedics, Cardiology, Surgery, etc.) | Data of all tenants in the hospital |
| **Administrator** | Chief of Orthopedics | Manages all resources within the Orthopedics tenant (users, agents, knowledge bases, etc.) | All data of this department (this tenant) |
| **Developer** | Chief Physicians and Associate Chief Physicians of Orthopedics Sub-specialties | Creates and edits clinical auxiliary agents, uploads professional materials to knowledge bases | Resources authorized within this department; self-created resources are manageable |
| **Regular User** | Resident Physicians, Nurses, Patients | Uses published agents for work assistance, information queries, health education | Resources authorized for use within this department; view-only, no editing |
