</div>

### Use Voice Input

Nexent supports voice input (make sure you have configured the speech model under [Model Management](./model-management) beforehand) so you can interact by speaking:

1. **Enable Voice Input**
   - Find the microphone icon in the lower right corner of the input box
   - Click the microphone icon to enable voice input
   - The first time you use it, you’ll be asked for microphone permission—please click "Allow"

2. **Start Speech Recognition**
   - After granting permission, the microphone icon will change to recording mode
   - Speak your question or command clearly
   - The system will convert your speech to text in real time and display it in the input box

3. **Complete Voice Input**
   - After speech recognition is complete, the system will automatically send the message
   - You can also manually edit the recognized text before sending
   - Both Chinese and English speech recognition are supported

> 💡 **Tip:** For better recognition results, use it in a quiet environment and articulate clearly.

### Upload Files for Chat

You can upload files during a chat so the agent can reason over their content:

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> 1. Multimodal file conversations require the agent to have the corresponding parsing tools enabled during agent development. 
>    2. For document or text files select the `analyze_text_file` tool.
>    3. For image files select the `analyze_image` tool.
> 2. Each uploaded file should ideally be under 10 MB. Split large documents into multiple uploads.

1. **Choose a File Upload Method**
   - Click the file upload button in the lower right corner of the input box
   - Or drag files directly into the chat area

2. **Supported File Formats**
   - **Documents:** PDF, Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), Excel (.xlsx), EPUB (.epub), HTML (.html), XML (.xml)
   - **Text & Data:** Markdown (.md), Plain text (.txt), JSON (.json), CSV (.csv)
   - **Images:** JPG, PNG, GIF, and other common formats

3. **File Processing Flow**
   - The platform stores the uploaded file in MinIO and returns an S3 URL
   - It builds structured file metadata and injects it into the active conversation
   - The agent then answers your questions based on both the prompt and file metadata

4. **File-based Chat**
   - After uploading a file, ask questions about its contents at any time
   - The agent can call the relevant multimodal tools to analyze, summarize, or process the data
   - Multiple files can be uploaded and processed simultaneously

## 📚 Manage Your Chat History

The left sidebar provides complete chat history management:

### Create a New Chat

- Click the "New Conversation" button in the upper left corner to start a brand new conversation
